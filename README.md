# envsimpoc2d

This is a 2D version of my other repository [envsimpoc](https://github.com/NickDevoctomy/envsimpoc).

The intention of this project is to attempt to create a tile based map with environmental factors which could potentially be used in a game.

With the 3D POC that I created, I found the framerate to be quite difficult to keep constant and map generation to be slow.  Ideally I would like this POC to be able to simulate a map of around 1000x1000 tiles.

## Environmental Factors

### Temperature

Heat transfer between tiles based upon a conductivity factor of the tile, 0 being not conductive at all and 1 being the most conductive.

## Notes

Please note that this code is merely a proof of concept and as such should not be used for anything serious without some major refactoring first.
